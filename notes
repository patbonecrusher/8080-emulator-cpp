# Instruction
* mnemonic (its name)
* length (in bytes)
* duration (in cyles) (sometime min/max)
* flags
* code

## Instruction types
* misc/control instruction
* jump/calls
* 8 bits load/store/move
* 16 bits load/store/move
* 8 bits arithmetic/logical
* 16 bits arithmetics/logical

20MHZ = 2,000,000 clock cycles per second



Flags
The processor maintains internal flag bits (a status register), which indicate the results of arithmetic and logical instructions. The flags are:

Sign (S), set if the result is negative.
Zero (Z), set if the result is zero.
Parity (P), set if the number of 1 bits in the result is even.
Carry (C), set if the last addition operation resulted in a carry or if the last subtraction operation required a borrow
Auxiliary carry (AC or H), used for binary-coded decimal arithmetic (BCD).

The carry bit can be set or complemented by specific instructions. Conditional-branch instructions test the various flag status bits. The flags can be copied as a group to the accumulator. The A accumulator and the flags together are called the PSW register, or program status word.`
